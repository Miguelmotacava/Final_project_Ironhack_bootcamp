# Final_project_Ironhack_bootcamp


The main objetive of this project is to create a form of visualise the information of the players of the game " Fifa 23" , make comparations between players and predictions of the price of them at the competitive mode of the videogame, the ultimate team. In order to do that we followed these steps:


1)  Create a data base of the players (the cards) with all the information we could scrap.

2)  Create a second database in which it is going to contain the price of the players in real time and, then, upload to a MongoDB cloud database

3) Visualitation of the data via Streamlit. This representation havve 3 parts. Firstly, a player research which give us the informmation of the player we decide of all the Fifa that are currently availeable (06/10/2022). Secondly, a comparation of two or more players we choose that show the main differences between them. Third, a simple model of predictions of the future prices the cards could have.

      The streamlit visualizsation have this look:
